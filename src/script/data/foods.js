    'How to make:</br><p>Pick through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain, and set aside.Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a solid block that you’ll have to break up later In a large pot over medium-high heat, sauté the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.Add the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute.Now add the cumin, paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices.Congratulate yourself on how amazing your house now smells.Immediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt.Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.After it has come to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.After the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire.Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.Serve with crushed-up crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.You could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.Makes great leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week..</p>',

    description: 'How to make:</br><p>STEP 1 TO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS: Pat out some rice. Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear. STEP 2 Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice. STEP 3 Add the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings – here we’ve used tuna and cucumber. STEP 4 Roll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll. STEP 5 Stick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll. STEP 6 Wrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film. STEP 7 TO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film. STEP 8 Cover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one. STEP 9 Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film. STEP 10 TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping. STEP 11 Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.</p>',

Pat the beans dry with a towel. Grind the beans in a food mill or meat grinder.If neither appliance is available, process them in a food processor but only until the beans form a paste.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Shape the bean mixture into 1-inch balls.Flatten slightly and coat with flour. Heat at least 1½-inches of oil over medium heat to 365 degrees.

    description: 'How to make:</br><p>Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into similarly sized pieces for even cooking. In a large soup pot, boil the potatoes and the bay leaves in salted water for 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. If youre not using a bag of ready-cut curly kale, wash the bunches thoroughly under cool running water to get rid of all soil—you wouldnt want that gritty texture in your finished dish. Trim any coarse stems and discard any brown leaves. With a sharp knife, cut the curly kale into thin strips. Peel and chop the shallots. In a frying pan or skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of butter and saute the shallots for a few minutes before adding the curly kale and 2 tbsp. of water. Season and cook for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Warm the milk on the stove or in the microwave. Drain, shake and dry the potatoes with kitchen towels before mashing with a potato masher or ricer. Working quickly, add the warm milk and the remaining butter. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix the cooked curly kale through the cooked mashed potato mixture. Top with slices of the smoked sausage and serve hot with your favorite mustard or gravy. Serve and enjoy!</p>',

    description: 'How to make:</br><p>Combine the marinade ingredients in a large ziplock bag (or bowl). Add the chicken and use your hands to make sure each piece is coated. If using a ziplock bag, I find it convenient to close the bag then massage the bag to disperse the rub all over each chicken piece. Marinate overnight or up to 24 hours. Combine the Yoghurt Sauce ingredients in a bowl and mix. Cover and put in the fridge until required (it will last for 3 days in the fridge). Heat grill/BBQ (or large heavy based pan on stove) on medium high. You should not need to oil it because the marinade has oil in it and also thigh fillets have fat. But if you are worried then oil your hotplate/grill. (See notes for baking) Place chicken on the grill and cook the first side for 4 to 5 minutes until nicely charred, then turn and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes (the 2nd side takes less time). Remove chicken from the grill and cover loosely with foil. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes. TO SERVE Slice chicken and pile onto platter alongside flatbreads, Salad and the Yoghurt Sauce. To make a wrap, get a piece of flatbread and smear with Yoghurt Sauce. Top with a bit of lettuce and tomato and Chicken Shawarma. Roll up and enjoy!<p>',
